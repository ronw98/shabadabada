# ShabadApp
## Short description
Face your friends and family in this song battle game!

## Description
This application is a non official mobile version of the french card game Shabadabada.

The rules are simple (and of course, tweak them as you please):
- Divide into two groups et hit play in the app
- You'll land on a screen containing a card with two words, chose one of these words
- In turn, each team must find and sing a song containing the chosen word. Careful! Some words are in italic, these words are categories: you must sing a word belonging to the category. For example if the card shows *an animal* in italic, you can sing songs with tiger, cat, whale... in it but you cannot sing a song containing exactly the word "animal"
- Continue to come up with unsung songs until one team is out of ideas. The last team to have found a song scores one point
- Click on the card to reveal the next one, and repeat the process!
- Most important: have fun!
- Careful: As this is inspired by a french game, half of the words are french words, if you don't want to sing in french, juste chose the english word on the card or just skip to the next card


Coming next:
- Adding some settings to add a timer, keep track of points...
- Allow you to edit the wordlist, add your own words, use words from only one language instead of french and english.
